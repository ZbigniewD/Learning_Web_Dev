Welcome! This repository is my personal open-source journal where I document my journey of learning front-end web development. I am building a series of small, focused projects to practice and master core technologies.

My primary goal is to create clean, well-documented code and beautiful user interfaces, inspired by the **Material Design Expressive** philosophy.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Workflow

Each project in this repository follows a structured, 4-phase development process to simulate a professional environment:

1. **Research & Learning:** Study the required concepts before coding.
2. **Design & Planning:** Create wireframes and a technical blueprint.
3. **Execution & Version Control:** Build the project with clean code and frequent Git commits.
4. **Review & Refactor:** Analyze the result and improve the code.

This repository itself is my first project in learning how to manage a project with Git and GitHub.
